        Explanation Imagine someone adds a To Do. The backend would receive a request from the frontend,
        it would check if the title is already being used, and if it's not, it would add the To Do.

        Problem The check if the title is already being used only works if the To Do has already been
        added. But if the user on the front end presses the "create To Do" button 10x, it would send
        10 requests, creating 10 To Do's.
            ?Solution Disable the button after the user clicks, only allowing one request to be made.

                Problem This would not work if the user was sending requests outside the frontend.
                Using postmark for example.
                Problem Avoiding race conditions is not the frontend job.

            ?Solution Using atomic operations. This one would take huge amounts of time to explain.
            But basically it doesn't work since nodejs is single-threaded. Again, this is a very summed
            up answer.

        Solution Using updateOne.
        The idea is to check if there are already a todo with the title passed on the parameter.
            updateOne({ email, title })
                Checks if someone with that email already added a to do with that title.
        If so, just update the to do with the new information.
        If no to do with that title was added by the user, create a new one.
            { upsert: true }
                No data found to update, create a new one.
